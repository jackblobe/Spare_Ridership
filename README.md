#  Welcome to my capstone project with Lighthouse Labs!
For my final project, I partnered with Spare labs to investigate the influence 
microtransit has on marganalized and mobility challeneged individuals. Using their ridership data from around the US, I paired latitude and longitude pickup points with Census block groupings from the US census. Using these blocks, I created Geojsons to create visualizations within Kepler Gl, which allowed for visuals which could show race and population data. 

Using ridership data, I made a time series analysis as well as a wait time predictor for passengers using Spare's services within Dallas, and through DBSCAN lowered the RMSE to well below baseline. 

Currently, I am completing a deep spatiotemporal wait time predictor based off of many of the models produced for DiDi and Uber demand which couple CNN's and LSTM's to include time factors as well as external demand.
